Put in this folder your emotion-annotated data in .txt. 
The (tab separated) data have the format:

Sentence_id	Emotion_label	Text

After preprocessing, the pipeline will be run on data_preprocessed.txt,
which has the format

Sentence_id	Emotion_label	TargetEmotion Text

Note that the column TargetEmotion is present even for the simple analysis
of the NMT output (where it is just a placeholder).
