The type of entries depend on the goal of the pipeline usage,
which you can indicate in the ../config.ini file.

* Simple analysis of emotion back-translation (RQ1 in the paper):

  Backtranslation is the one spontaneously retourned by the NMT system, 
  which receives one emotion_score for each Emotion label in the dataset.
  

* Recovering of emotion-preserving back-translation (RQ2):
  
  Backtranslation is the one that our re-ranking method chooses among
  the n-best translations retourned by the NMT system as the one
  preserving the original emotion.
  It receives one emotion_score for each Emotion label in the dataset.

* Style transfer (RQ3):

  Backtranslation is the one that our re-ranking method chooses among
  the n-best translations retourned by the NMT system as the one having
  a target emotion.
  Each Emotion label is used as a target emotion, and receives an
  emotion_score by the classifier.


You can set the parameters for usage goal and number of back translations in
../scripts/config.ini. Parameters values are explained in config.doc.
