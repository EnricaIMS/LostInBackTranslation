The output of the pipeline will be saved in this folder.

* scored_input.txt contains the emotion probabilities for
  the input texts.

* scored_backtranslations.txt contains emotion probabilities
for the output texts, in the following (tab separated) format: 
Sentence_id	Emotion	Backtranslation	emotion_score

* deltas.txt contains the average differences between
  emotions in the input and the output.

The type of entries dependns on the goal of the pipeline usage,
which you can indicate in the config file.

* Simple analysis of emotion back-translation (RQ1 in the paper):

  Backtranslation is the one spontaneously retourned by the NMT 
  system, which receives one emotion_score for each Emotion label 
  in the dataset.
  

* Recovering of emotion-preserving back-translation (RQ2):
  
  Backtranslation is the one that our re-ranking method chooses
  among the n-best translations retourned by the NMT system as 
  the one preserving the original emotion.
  It receives one emotion_score for each Emotion label in the dataset.

* Style transfer (RQ3):

  Backtranslation is the one that our re-ranking method chooses 
  among the n-best translations retourned by the NMT system as the 
  one having the highest probability for target emotion.
  Each Emotion label is used as a target emotion, and receives an
  emotion_score by the classifier.


You can set the parameters for usage goal and number of back translations in
../config/config.ini. Parameters values are explained in config-documentation.ini.
